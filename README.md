# Nvim Config
My nvim config.

## General Information
Well, this is based on the [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE&ab_channel=ThePrimeagen) 
of [@ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua), an awesome guy!

## Requirements (for plugins)
> If you want to ensure that all runs well, you can check the requirements of
> each plugin (check out [packer file](./lua/omargtdev/packer.lua)).

- Install [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep)


## Setup

So, to install and manage plugins, you need to install [packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim).
Then open neovim, and type `:PackerSync`. That's all!
